# Data Analyst Nanodegree with OpenClassRooms

At OpenClassrooms, the learning process is project-driven because thatâ€™s the fastest way to become proficient and to get some hands-on experiences. 
The Data Analyst degree include 9 projects to get through all the fundamentals of the Data Analyst Role:

- Perform database searches using SQL queries to retrieve relevant data:
  - MySQL
  - PostGreSQL

- Data Wrangling: 
  - gathering, selecting, and transforming data into valuable and reliable source of information.
  - techniques to handle: Missing Data and Outliers.

- Apply supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm such as:
  - Linear Regression.
  - Logistic Regression.
  - Decision Tree and/or Random Forest. 
  - kNN and K-Means.
  - Hierarchical clustering (HCA)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Apply key mathematical and statistical concepts for data analysis.

- Create informative data visualizations, dashboards and reports to facilitate the decision making process.

This repository get through the key learnings related to the Project no.7.

## Project 7 - Revenue Prediction: Create a model to predict the revenues of potential customers using ANOVA and Linear Regression.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Create a model to predict the future revenue of children based on their location, the revenue of their parents and the gini index; in order to target future customers.


  1) Data Collection

Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system, which then enables one to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes[Wikipedia]. Here is what we need to perform the modeling:

- World Income Distribution: This database is mainly composed of studies carried out at the national level for a good number of countries, and contains the income distributions of the populations concerned.
- Gini Index from the World Bank: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI
- Number of inhabitants of each country present in the data.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal of Step 1: Collect, Summarize and Discuss the relevance of the Data Collected for the Modeling.
  - Year(s) selected
  - Countries selected
  - World Population coverage by selection
  - Description of data from World Income Distribution
